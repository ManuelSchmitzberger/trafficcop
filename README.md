###Basic Idea/Motivation
* The idea is to allow people to connect to a wifi hotspot and then immediately be able to simulate shitty mobile network connections from developing countries.
* Lets developers easily test application performance with on slow connection in mind
* Relates to ‚Äúmobile first‚Äù thinking by acknowledging ‚Äúmobile first‚Äù means connections that are not always as reliable/speedy/generally good (i.e. üí©).

###Specification
* Ability to introduce extra:
 * Latency (delay)
 * Jitter (variance of latency/delay)
 * Packet loss
 * Bandwidth limitations
 * Per MAC address throttling ‚Üí i.e. web interface such that you can go and adjust the setting for your client only.
* Stretch goals:
 * Simulate duplicate packets
 * Out of order arrival
 * Force TCP retransmission
